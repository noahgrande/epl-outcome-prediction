# AI Usage Statement

## Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools

This project was developed with limited and transparent use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, in accordance with the course rules and academic integrity guidelines.

AI tools (notably large language models such as ChatGPT) were used **exclusively as supportive tools** during the development process. Their use was restricted to the following purposes:

- Clarifying programming concepts (e.g. Python syntax, machine learning workflows, evaluation metrics).
- Improving code readability, structure, and documentation (comments, docstrings, README formatting).
- Assisting with debugging by suggesting potential causes of errors or alternative implementations.
- Helping reformulate explanations in a clearer and more academic style, particularly in English.

## What AI Was *Not* Used For

AI tools were **not** used for:
- Generating final model results or empirical findings.
- Designing the core methodology of the project.
- Making modeling decisions without human validation.
- Automatically writing complete solutions that were submitted without understanding or modification.
- Producing figures, tables, or numerical outputs directly used in the report.

All modeling choices, data preprocessing steps, feature engineering decisions, experiments, evaluations, and interpretations were **designed and implemented by student**.
